a) Update and upgrade installed packages

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

b) Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

5) Create a new user account named grader

While logged in as ubuntu, add user: sudo adduser grader

6) Give grader the permission to sudo

While logged in as root, vim /etc/sudoers 
Search for the line that looks like this:
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Below this line, add a new line to give sudo privileges to grader user.
grader  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Save and exit using CTRL+X and confirm with Y.

Verify that grader has sudo permissions. Run su - grader, enter the password, run sudo -l



7) Create an SSH key pair for grader using the ssh-keygen tool

 On the local machine:
        Run ssh-keygen
        Enter file in which to save the key (I gave the name grader_key) in the local directory ~/.ssh
        Enter in a passphrase twice. Two files will be generated ( ~/.ssh/grader_key and ~/.ssh/grader_key.pub)
        Run cat ~/.ssh/grader_key.pub and copy the contents of the file
        Log into the ec2 instance .

On the grader's virtual machine (ec2 instance):

 Create a new directory called ~/.ssh (mkdir .ssh)
 Run sudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and paste the content into this file, save and exit
 
Give the permissions: 
chmod 700 .ssh 
and 
chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys
Check in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file if PasswordAuthentication is set to yes
Restart SSH: sudo service ssh restart
Login from your local using sudo ssh -i ~/.ssh/grader_key  grader@13.126.138.52

8) Configure the local timezone to UTC

While logged in as grader, configure the time zone: sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata.
You should see something like that:

Current default time zone: 'America/Chicago'
